{"description": "Product : EA SPORTSâ„¢ WRC Platform : Steam-PC Summarize your bug On the main menu's Top right UI, sometimes XP level # isn't updated right after leveling up. It'll require the user to navigate to another menu page to force a refresh. How often does the bug occur? Occasionally (10% - 49%) Steps: How can we find the bug ourselves? 1 - Finishing a series of sessions that give enough points to level up Pass progression 2- Returning to main menu, after a bit on top right the amount of points earned will show. P.e, +3650. 3- After these points are added, the progression bar will be successfully updated, showing a small % advance for the new/current level reached by player (and trigger the new items available message). On the other hand, the XP Lvl # will bug out and remain at the previous level without being updated. (this is only cosmetic) 4- Only after navigating to another menu, such as going to check pass progression under customization, the current XP Level will be updated on the top right UI. What happens when the bug occurs? XP Level on main menu top right UI isn't updated right when advancing level, coming from a series of events. It'll only refresh after navigating to another menu page that causes it to update. What do you expect to see? XP Level correctly updated â€Œ This minor bug isn't new, already happened on the first season after game release. Today it happened while progressing from level 9 to 10.

{"description": "EA SPORTS WRC is a game where drivers compete against the stopwatch to se the fastest times on every rally stage. As such, it is important that the stages provide a fair experience for all drivers, particularly those in a competitive environment such as Time Trial, Clubs or esports. To further ensure the competitive fairness of the game, several corners across the game's 600+km of unique roads feature various elements to limit the possibility of a driver \"cutting a corner\" to gain an advantage, including: Rougher terrain Rocks, trees and other obstacles Reset zones Anti-Cut Blocks, that issue penalties Although the majority of the game's stages are \"cut-free\", there may be some specific turns where the optimal racing line is not the intended one. Our team is hard at work identifying all of these and handling corrections in future patches, though you can help speed up this process by flagging any problematic corners to us for investigation. If you come across an exploitable corner, make a post in this thread by following these steps: Go to Racenet.com, then to Analysis . Choose the stage and car class where the exploitable corner was seen. Choose the player on the Leaderboard who is showing off the exploit (if you found it, select your leaderboard entry). Screenshot the section where the corner-cut has taken place. The stage name and progress bar must both be visible as these help the team identify the corner that needs amending. If you have video footage, that can also help, but Racenet data is the best source. Here is an example of how to report a corner. As you can see it's very simple, just need stage, country and a Racenet screenshot, nothing more.", "image_urls": ["https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/EA-SPORTS-WRC-Report-Corner-Cutting-Exploits-Here/td-p/13223041?attachment-id=761970", "https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/EA-SPORTS-WRC-Report-Corner-Cutting-Exploits-Here/td-p/13223041?attachment-id=762243", "https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/EA-SPORTS-WRC-Report-Corner-Cutting-Exploits-Here/td-p/13223041?attachment-id=762244", "https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/EA-SPORTS-WRC-Report-Corner-Cutting-Exploits-Here/td-p/13223041?attachment-id=762245", "https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/EA-SPORTS-WRC-Report-Corner-Cutting-Exploits-Here/td-p/13223041?attachment-id=762242"]},
